## Employee Attrition Analysis Project

# Overview
  This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to reveal the determinants contributing to attrition. The goal is to understand the factors influencing employee turnover and provide insights for retention strategies.

# Data
  The project uses a dataset containing information about employees, including features such as age, gender, job role, salary, satisfaction level, and attrition 
  status.

# Analysis
- Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values and ensure data quality.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to understand the relationships between different variables and 
  their impact on attrition.
- Determinants of Attrition: The EDA reveals key determinants contributing to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, etc.
- Insights: Insights from the analysis can be used to formulate strategies for improving employee retention and reducing attrition rates.

# Usage
- Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and contains relevant information for analysis.
- EDA: Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform EDA on the dataset.
- Analysis: Use the insights from the analysis to make informed decisions regarding employee retention strategies.

# Results
  The project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing employee attrition, which can be used by organizations to improve employee retention 
  and overall workforce satisfaction.

# Future Work
- Explore advanced machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
- Conduct surveys or interviews to gather more qualitative data for analysis.
